# C - Search Algorithms

This repository contains a collection of search algorithms implemented in the C programming language. The project aims to provide a better understanding of search algorithms and their applications. Each algorithm is implemented according to specific requirements and follows the Betty coding style.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completing this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without the need for external references:

- What is a search algorithm?
- What is a linear search?
- What is a binary search?
- What is the best search algorithm to use based on different needs?

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the following flags: -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All files should end with a new line
- Your code should follow the Betty coding style. You can use betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl to check your code.
- Usage of global variables is not allowed
- Each file should contain no more than 5 functions
- Only the printf function from the standard library is allowed. Other standard library functions such as strdup and malloc are forbidden.
- You should include a README.md file at the root of the project folder

## Big O Notations

When analyzing the time complexity of algorithms, the following notations are used:

- O(1)
- O(n)
- O(n!)
- O(nm)
- O(n^2)
- O(sqrt(n))
- O(log(n))
- O(nlog(n))

Feel free to explore the implementation of the search algorithms and refer to the provided big O notations for a better understanding of the time complexity.

Remember to push your changes and enjoy exploring the world of search algorithms in C!
